To install, copy everything into a directory, and creat a
directory called random_directory in that directory.

To read about one of the python files, do the following:

./pydoc python_file_name

The ./pydoc file is a shellscript that strips off the ending
.py so that the real pydoc does the right thing, while you
can still use tab completion for filenames.

For each Python file, in the order specified by programs.otl,
read about the program with ./pydoc to see what it does,
then run the program, then look at the source code.
